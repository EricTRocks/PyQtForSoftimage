	SDK files are read using the blurdev/gui/windows/sdkwindow
	
	This is for Python libraries only at the moment, as it uses the python inspect module to dynamically generate
	help documentation based on code comments and imported data.
	
	To use, you have to include the modules that you want to import and parse for the documentation by adding lines like:
	
	<module loc="[installpath]/code/python/lib" name="my_module"/>
